You (should) now have a virtual machine running Meteor / Meteorite!\r\n\r\nTips and Tricks~\r\n================\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with vagrant, you can ssh into the machine with 'vagrant ssh'. When you do this, you'll want to type 'cd /vagrant' and make / clone your project from there to make use of Vagrants synchronized folders feature.\r\n\r\nBy default, port 3000 is fowarded to port 4567, so when Meteor says it's running on localhost:3000, you can connect to it via 127.0.0.1:4567.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
